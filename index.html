    </header>

    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Rooted in the rich tapestry of Pakistani folklore, the timeless love story of Sohni and Mahiwal finds new
            life among the stars. In this futuristic retelling, Sohni is not just a potter but a creator of celestial
            shields, her art bridging the cosmic divide. Mahiwal, a rogue pilot from a forbidden star system, discovers
            her work and is drawn into her orbit—both figuratively and literally. However, galactic laws enforced by the
            Regulators forbid such connections. As their love blossoms, they must face the unyielding laws of their
            galaxies, a jealous rival, and the swirling dangers of the Nebula Barrier. Can love defy cosmic forces, or
            will their story end in the stars?</p>

            <p>Living on a terraformed moon at the edge of the Nebula Barrier, Sohni crafts celestial shields that blend
                her ancestors’ legends with quiet rebellion. Her work is a defiant tribute to a fractured legacy, as her
                estranged brother Sarosh abandoned their craft to join the Regulators. Isolated but resilient, Sohni’s
                artistry becomes the light that guides Mahiwal through the chaos.</p>

        <h2>Act I: The Meeting</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
            <img src="images/nebula.jpg" alt="The Nebula Barrier">
            <p>On a quiet night, as the Nebula Barrier crackled with faint blue-green light, Mahiwal’s spacecraft
                crash-landed near Sohni’s moon. Sohni, working late in her workshop, saw the fiery trail and hurried to
                investigate.

                Her celestial shields, glowing softly under starlight, were a testament to her family’s craft—a legacy
                fractured when her brother, Jahangir, turned away from their art to join the Regulators. Sohni had
                poured
                her grief into her work, each shield bearing intricate patterns that blended cosmic geometry with the
                legends of her ancestors.

                When she found Mahiwal among the wreckage, disoriented but unafraid, her first instinct was caution. Yet
                something in his gaze—a quiet determination, a refusal to surrender—stirred her curiosity. He introduced
                himself as a fugitive fleeing the Regulators, his ship battered from crossing the Nebula. Despite her
                better judgment, Sohni offered him refuge, unknowingly setting the stage for a love that would defy the
                galaxy.</p>

        <h2>Act II: Love Across Boundaries</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
            <img src="images/act2_refined.jpg" alt="Sohni and Mahiwal meeting near the Nebula">
            <p>The Nebula Barrier was a living wall of chaos—waves of debris, gravitational distortions, and
                unpredictable energy fields made it almost impossible to cross. Mahiwal’s ship, despite its battered
                state, had enough shielding to navigate its currents, but it could only stay hidden for short bursts.

                “You can’t stay,” Sohni said one night as Mahiwal repaired his ship in her workshop. “The Regulators
                track anomalies. If they find you here, they’ll destroy everything.”

                So, night after night, Mahiwal piloted through the perilous Nebula, guided by Sohni’s celestial shields.
                She placed them at the edge of her moon, lighting his path through the chaos. Their stolen moments were
                fleeting yet profound. Sohni shared stories of her ancestors, of love bound by rivers and torn apart by
                tradition. Mahiwal spoke of his rebellion against the Regulators and the freedom he sought across the
                stars.

                Each night, as he left, he whispered, “You light my way.”

        <h2>Act III: The Betrayal</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
            <img src="images/betrayal.jpg" alt="Sabotaged Ship">
            <p>The Regulators were not blind to Mahiwal’s movements. Among them was Jahangir, Sohni’s estranged brother.
                Once an artist like her, Jahangir had abandoned their family’s craft to join the Regulators, seeking
                power
                and order in a galaxy of chaos. While he admired Sohni’s shields, he saw her defiance as dangerous—a
                threat to the fragile control the Regulators held over the star systems.

                Jahangir’s jealousy flared when he discovered Mahiwal’s connection to her. To him, Mahiwal represented
                everything Sohni had abandoned her family for: rebellion, danger, and love. Under Jahangir’s orders,
                Sohni’s navigation signals were sabotaged. On a stormy night, the Nebula’s currents surged unnaturally,
                disrupting Mahiwal’s ship. Sohni waited anxiously, her shields glowing brighter as a warning, but
                Mahiwal never arrived. Instead, Jahangir’s fleet descended on her moon.

                Jahangir confronted her, his voice cold yet trembling. “You were supposed to carry on the family’s
                legacy,
                not use it to defy the galaxy’s order.”

                Sohni fought to defend herself, but the betrayal struck deeper than any physical attack. She realized
                Mahiwal, lured into a gravitational pocket, was losing control of his ship. Desperate, she activated
                every shield she had, but it wasn’t enough to break the trap.</p>

            <img src="images/act4_refined.jpg" alt="Mahiwal sacrificing himself near the vortex">
            <p>Mahiwal’s voice crackled over the transmission. “Sohni, don’t stop. Light the way.”

                He knew what he had to do. Using the last reserves of his ship’s shielding, he rerouted the Nebula’s
                surge, creating a narrow path for Sohni’s escape. As his ship disintegrated piece by piece, he whispered
                his final words: “You light my way.”

                Sohni’s ship broke through the Nebula, tears blurring her vision as she saw Mahiwal consumed by the
                storm. The Regulators retreated, their forces scattered by the Nebula’s fury. Sohni, now alone, gazed at
                the stars where Mahiwal had vanished. A new constellation shimmered into view, its lights resembling her
                celestial shields—a tribute to a love that had defied galaxies.</p>
